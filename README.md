# DireCamp
Repository for first actual project.

This was a small project done in my undergrad, Compsci 2150 class. This was for a large percentage of our grade. We had just
under a month to try and complete this. It had to incorporate polymorphisim and interfaces. 
Let me know what you think. Email me at mikemorten1979@memphis.edu. 

Remember, these are the younger years...
